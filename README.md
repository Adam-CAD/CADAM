# CADAM

A Text to CAD Web Application

## What it does:

- Generates parametric 3D models from natural language descriptions, with support for both text prompts and image references
- Outputs OpenSCAD code with automatically extracted parameters that surface as interactive sliders for instant dimension tweaking
- Separate agents for conversation and code generation; simple parameter tweaks bypass AI entirely using deterministic regex-based updates
- Exports as .STL or .SCAD
- Runs fully in-browser by compiling OpenSCAD to WebAssembly and integrating Three.js with React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Supports BOSL, BOSL2, and MCAD libraries and custom font support (Geist) for text in models

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Supabase CLI
- ngrok (for local webhook development)

## Setting Up Environment Variables

### 1. Frontend Environment:

- Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local`
- Update all required keys in `.env.local`:
  ```
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<Test Anon Key>"
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1:54321'
  ```

### 2. Supabase Functions Environment:

- Copy `supabase/functions/.env.template` to `supabase/functions/.env`
- Update all required keys in `supabase/functions/.env`, including:
  ```
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<Test Anthropic API Key>"
  ENVIRONMENT="local"
  NGROK_URL="<NGROK URL>" # Your ngrok tunnel URL, e.g., https://xxxx-xx-xx-xxx-xx.ngrok.io
  ```

## Setting Up ngrok for Local Development

CADAM uses ngrok to send image URLs to Anthropic:

1. Install ngrok if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   # or
   brew install ngrok
   ```

2. Start an ngrok tunnel pointing to your Supabase instance:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 54321
   ```

3. Copy the generated ngrok URL (e.g., https://xxxx-xx-xx-xxx-xx.ngrok.io) and add it to your `supabase/functions/.env` file:

   ```
   NGROK_URL="https://xxxx-xx-xx-xxx-xx.ngrok.io"
   ```

4. Ensure `ENVIRONMENT="local"` is set in the same file.

## Development Workflow

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Start Supabase Services

```bash
npx supabase start
npx supabase functions serve --no-verify-jwt
```
